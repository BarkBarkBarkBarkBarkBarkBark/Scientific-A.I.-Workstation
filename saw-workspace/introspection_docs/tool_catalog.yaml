OUTPUT YAML ONLY. No prose.

Produce `ToolCatalogSnapshot_v1` listing every tool/action you can invoke from this chat session.

For each tool:
- tool_id
- backend (saw_api|mcp)
- args_schema (brief)
- side_effects (disk_read/disk_write/network/subprocess)
- approval_required (true/false)
- availability (available|unavailable) with evidence

Include evidence by actually calling the tool-listing mechanism you have (or stating it's unavailable).
